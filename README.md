# Fallarium.js

## What is this?
Fallarium.js is a game inspired by Damian Yerrick's Tetanus On Drugs(TM). It is a falling block game with added visual effects commonly associated with hallucinogens.

## Why?!?
I played a lot of Tetanus on Drugs(TM) when I was younger, mainly the GBA port. I recently rediscovered my love for it and want to make it available to users of modern computers and those without GBA flashcarts. The original version of the game (non-GBA) was written over 10 years ago for computers much less powerful. I was initially going to update the PC version, but after sitting on it and doing nothing for two years, I've decided to remake it for the web.
